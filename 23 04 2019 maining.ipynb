      " he said.       premium parking operates 35 parking locations in new orleans and has just expanded to houston. the company has 100 employees.       jim garner, an attorney for fred levin, a pensacola lawyer who previously owned the site and provided financing for the developers,said that levin foreclosed on poydras llc in the spring after the company stopped making payments on its lease-purchase agreement for the site.       garner said levin bid on the project to make sure that he was made whole on the money he lent. garner said that the property is worth more than what huger paid for it.       the failure of the trump tower project also marks the end of spate of new-construction luxury condominium projects that were announced around the time of the storm when the national real estate market was hot and money was flowing.       vantage tower, a 25-story condominium project announced in january 2006 at girod street and o'keefe avenue downtown, was cancelled in february 2007 as rising construction costs made units too expensive for buyers.       the 24-story tracage proposed in february 2006 at 1100 annunciation street in the warehouse district was put on hold in april 2009 because of the economy. although a banner remained in place for ages at the site, it was sold at a tax sale last november for $19,023.75 to a company in minnesota called lakeview holding llc, according to conveyance records.       but even as these projects crumbled, the trump tower developers insisted they were moving forward, and opened a sales office in the neighboring pan american life center in january 2008 as the nation was in recession.       in may, the new york times reported that real estate tycoon and television personality donald trump essentially rented his name to developers to make condo projects more valuable, even though he had little to do with them.       kurt weigle, president and chief executive of the downtown development district, said it's no surprise that trump tower and the other luxury condominium projects ran into trouble. the national finance market is tough, many people are more interested in renting rather than buying right now, and while downtown new orleans is moving in a great direction, new construction is expensive and the per-square foot sales prices are still too low to make the numbers work.       weigle is unconcerned by the failure of trump tower. what's more important, he said, is the redevelopment of many smaller buildings downtown into apartments that has allowed the residential population downtown to double over the past decade.       people in new orleans are looking for apartments rather than condos, weigle said, and that's well-matched to the type of financing tools that are available to developers. the easiest way to finance a project right now is through state and federal tax historic credits, which lend themselves to apartment construction, because the federal credits prevent developers from selling the units for five years.       with some 5,100 people living downtown and demand for the new apartment units strong, weigle said downtown sales prices will eventually rise, which will make new construction condominium projects feasible.       \\\n",
